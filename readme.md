## Introduction

Graph Journey is a visualization tool for graph algorithms, aimed at aiding understanding through graphical representations of complex algorithms. Each algorithm is demonstrated with step-by-step animations that illustrate its operations on different graph structures, making it ideal for educational purposes.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations for several core graph algorithms.
- Step-by-step animations for better comprehension of algorithmic workflows.
- Supports directed and undirected graphs.
- Utilizes Python libraries such as NetworkX for graph operations and Matplotlib for visualizations.
- Designed to be beginner-friendly and suitable for educational use.

## Algorithms Visualized

The following algorithms are included and visualized in this project:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Explores as far along each branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
3. **Topological Sort** - Linear ordering of vertices for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
4. **Connected Components** - Identifies all connected components in a graph.
5. **Kruskal’s Algorithm** - Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by selecting edges in increasing order of weight.
6. **Prim’s Algorithm** - Builds the MST by adding the shortest edge from the explored set of nodes.

## Installation
To run the visualizations:

1. Open the `Graph_Journey.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to see the algorithm visualizations.
3. Modify the graph parameters in the notebook cells to customize the visualizations.
